Ronan, Celine, Daniela, CÃ©line, David, Preethi and Tuan are working on LNRS' model. They need help with the documentation and test elements to validate it. LNRS will be subject to ongoing performance monitoring. It must specify every year the identified defects and share the defects with the clients. It should be the responsibility of the client to adapt to everyones' risk approach. The documentation is not always accurate and it's not always consistent.
